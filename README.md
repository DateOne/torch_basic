# torch_basic

some basic hands-on projects with pytorch (inspired by many)

## here is the list

* residual neural networks (very basic)
* LSTM (very basic)
* deep convolutional GAN
* style transfer
* transfer learning (very basic)
* spatial transformer
* adversarial attack
* prototypical neural networks (omniglot, miniimagenet)
